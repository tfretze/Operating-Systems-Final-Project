# Operating-Systems-Final-Project
Program simulates a system that uses paging with virtual memory. 
Processes are schedlued using round-robin scheduling
Compares the performance of LRU and CLK page replacement algorithms

To Run Example:
java A3 30 3 process1.txt process2.txt process3.txt 

â€¦where 30 is the number of frames (F), 3 is the quantum size (Q) for Round Robin algorithm, and the
other arguments are text file names containing page references for each process.
